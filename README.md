Project: Simple Sql Engine Checkpoint 2
Instrction: ./doc/
Testcase: ./testcase/
Library: lib/

Comment: In checkpoint2, a provided partial solution for checkpoint1 is used to build a Relational Algebra Tree, and the bugs in iterators in CP1 are fixed. moreover, the iterators are optimized with efficient algorithsm like HashJoin. However, the external sort and other memory limited function has not been finished in CP2.
